# STL_Sales_Data

The sales data is pulled from the Assessor files downloadable at OpenGov.

The data contains information for current and pass years and this code processes everything and compares it to the data up to the current year and only add data that is no present already allowing for updated past data.

There is a gap between 2010 and 2017; however, this should all be captured in the fact that 2017 contains all previously reported sales.
